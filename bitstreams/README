signal processing bitstreams for MeerKAT

The directory structure should mirror the ../source directory structure.

bitstreams should be committed without the timestamp to reduce the number of files in the repo.

tags should be used to note releases. 

Temporary experimental files (including timestamp) are welcomed providing they are removed later.
