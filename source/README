Simulink model files and other development source files

changes to .slx files should be committed before compiling. This ensures bitstreams
can be matched with the source used to build them. (BEWARE) This may result in non-compilable and/or
non-working slx files in git repo. 

Compiled bitstreams should be placed in bitstreams folder (see bitstreams/README)
